**raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to learn videogames programming.**

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib and by XNA framework.

raylib could be useful for prototyping, tools development, graphic applications, embedded systems and education.

NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to learn videogames programming; 
no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no auto-debugging... just coding in the most 
pure spartan-programmers way. Are you ready to learn? Jump to [code examples!](http://www.raylib.com/examples.html)

raylib uses on its [core](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/core.c) module the outstanding [GLFW3](http://www.glfw.org/) library, embedded inside raylib in the form of [rglfw](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rglfw.c) module, avoiding that way external dependencies.

raylib uses on its [audio](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/audio.c) module, the amazing [mini_al](https://github.com/dr-soft/mini_al) audio library, single-file header-only and supporting multiple platforms and multiple audio backends.

raylib uses internally multiple single-file header-only libraries to support multiple fileformats loading and saving, all those libraries are embedded with raylib and available in [src/external](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/tree/master/src/external) directory.

*On Android, `native_app_glue module` (provided by Android NDK) and native Android libraries are used to manage window/context, inputs and activity life cycle.*

*On Raspberry Pi, Videocore API and EGL libraries are used for window/context management and raw inputs reading.*

build and installation
----------------------

Binary releases for Windows, Linux and macOS are available at the [Github Releases](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases) page. raylib is also available via multiple package managers on multiple OS distributions. For more info check [raylib Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki).

To build raylib yourself, check out also the [raylib Wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki) for detailed instructions.

raylib has been developed using exclusively two tools: 

   * Notepad++ (text editor) - [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
   * MinGW (GCC compiler) - [http://www.mingw.org/](http://www.mingw.org/)
   
Those are the tools recommended to develop with raylib, in fact, those are the tools my students use.
